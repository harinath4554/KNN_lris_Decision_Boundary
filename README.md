## KNN Iris Decision Boundary

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification applied to the classic Iris dataset, with a focus on visualizing decision boundaries.

The project is intended for learning and exploration, helping illustrate how a distance-based classifier separates classes in feature space.

Overview

Uses the Iris dataset for multiclass classification

Implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm

Visualizes decision boundaries to show how predictions change across the feature space

Designed as an educational and exploratory notebook

Purpose

The main goal of this project is to provide an intuitive understanding of:

How KNN classification works

How the choice of features affects decision boundaries

How distance-based models behave visually
